## Exploratory Data Analysis Amazon Reviews
Amazon Alexa, also known simply as Alexa, is a virtual assistant technology developed by Amazon, first used in the Amazon Echo smart speaker and the Echo Dot, Echo Studio and Amazon Tap speakers developed by Amazon Lab126. It is capable of voice interaction, music playback, making to-do lists, setting alarms, streaming podcasts, playing audiobooks, and providing weather, traffic, sports, and other real-time information, such as news. Alexa can also control several smart devices using itself as a home automation system. Users are able to extend the Alexa capabilities by installing "skills" (additional functionality developed by third-party vendors, in other settings more commonly called apps) such as weather programs and audio features. It uses NLU (natural language understanding), speech recognition and other weak AI to perform these tasks.
